- 👋 Hi, I’m @LivPeake
- 👀 I’m interested in books, art, and activism
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and doing my BA in English Literature
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing until I get a bit better with the basics but one day I would love to make a website where people can contribute to ideas I have for video essays on activism, literature and reducing cultural erosion!
- 📫 How to reach me ...
